# TFT_vs_Fund
Pose estimation of 3 views based on the trifocal tensor and the fundamental matrix.

This MATLAB directory contains the code implemented for the ICIP 2017 submission "A Critical Review of the Trifocal Tensor Estimation" by Laura F. Julia and Pascal Monasse.

Two scripts are provided to easily use the code: 

example.m - Gives an example on how to use the code for pose estimation of three views.
